  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a continuous, multi-purpose longitudinal survey representing the population of Medicare beneficiaries living in the United States. This survey is authorized by section 1875 (42 USC 139511) of the Social Security Act and is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago (NORC) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The MCBS is sponsored by the Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics (OEDA) of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The MCBS is designed to aid CMS in administering, monitoring, and evaluating the Medicare program, and is essential in providing important information on beneficiaries that is not otherwise collected through operational or administrative data from the Medicare program.</p>
  <p>For more information about the MCBS, including unique features of the survey and the types of data available, see <a href='https://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/the-medicare-current-beneficiary-survey-.aspx' target='_blank'>NORC’s project page</a>.</p>
