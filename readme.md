#MCBS Data Static Site

##Installation

Run `npm install` to install eleventy and sass.

##Running local development server

`npm start` runs a local development server at `http://localhost:8080`. Changes to src files will recompile and auto-refresh in the browser.

##Building

The contents of the `public` folder will be the static site as it lives online.

`npm build` builds the contents of the `public` folder without running the development server.
